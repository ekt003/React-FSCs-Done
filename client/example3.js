/**
  This is a custom function that will accept a friend name
  and add it to the friends list for this container. 
  
  Then we will re-render the components to show the changes.
  
  When you have a small amount of data, this manual re-render is quick and 
  keeps the code clean. 
  
  !!Although!!
  If you have larger or more complex structures (not just a couple simple elements),
  then this (FSCs) becomes much more expensive and slow. In those cases, 
  using classes extending React.Component makes more sense. The code is more complicated,
  but it is much more performant.
  
  React is working hard on making FSCs to be much more performance optimized in future
  releases with the goal of moving towards them.
  
  ---
  Also notice, we are using .concat instead of push.
  The concat function will create a new array
  from the old array with the new values appended.
  
  We are doing this so that we do not modify the original
  array (not pushing to it). This means the original
  array has not been mutated. We call this immutability. 
  
  Why do we want the array to be immutable? 
  Well React and many frameworks check current values
  against the previous value to see differences. This 
  also means we can undo changes 
  (several times if we store several states).
  
  The difference check is actually much easier to maintain 
  and faster to calculate than trying to see if an array
  has been mutated over time (without having separate arrays or history).
  
  Changes in the array can trigger events like re-rendering and such. 
  Immutability makes this process much faster and easier.
