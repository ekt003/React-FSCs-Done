    If you have larger or more complex structures (not just a couple simple elements),

    using classes extending React.Component makes more sense. The code is more complicated,

    releases with the goal of moving towards them.

  These are events like onClick and onChange. They work similarly, but

  These will be inherited as this.props in children
  made by this element.
